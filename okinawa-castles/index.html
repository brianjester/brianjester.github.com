               </UL>

            <h3>Why Create a Guide?</h3>
            <p>I originally had the idea for this guide as a kind of augmentation to the Okinawa Island guides the US Marine Corps MWR (Moral Welfare and Recreation) usually handed out to servicemembers new to the island.  As I dug into the content for this guide, I began to realize I had been to the castles, but hadn’t really seen them, I had missed many exciting and interesting details.  So, this guide is an attempt to make up for that loss, and to both help and serve other island adventurers, hikers, history buffs, families with children, deployed service members, ESL teachers, and the just plain curious, to discover the amazing castles that have been patiently waiting for +500 years for you to discover on Okinawa.</p>

            <h3>How to Use this Guide</h3>
            <p>The guide is divided into the Introduction section, then a section for each region of the main Okinawa Island: Hokuzan (North), Chuzan (Central), Nanzan (South). Each castle has a full-page photo, a 1-page summary, a 3-star rating, and short paragraphs for “Points of Interest”, “Getting There and Parking”, “Where to Eat”, and “Side Trip”.  After the 1-page summary is a multi-page “Overview” and “On the Trail” descriptions of what you can expect as you make your way through the castle gates and journey back into history.  It’s my sincerest hope you’ll enjoy this guide and the best compliment you can give is to share and recommend this to your family and friends.</p>

            <h3>Regions</h3>
            <p>Okinawa Island is approx 100 km north to south, and on average 11 km east-west, and broken up into 3 historical regions during the Sanzan (3 mountain) period of 1314-1429.  They were: 
              <UL><LI>Hokuzan in the north</LI>
                <LI> Chuzan in the central area</LI>
                <LI>Nanzan in the south</LI>
              </UL>
            Hokuzan historically was all areas north of Ishikawa, including Nago City.  Chuzan was Ishikawa to Naha, and Nanzan was all points south of Naha.</p>

            <h3>The Maps</h3>
            <p>Maps and satellite views are provided to show both general location and points of interest in the area of the castle, and nearby.</p>

            <h3>Star Rating System</h3>
            <p>Each castle has been rated on a 3-star grading.  You don’t want to miss great sites, but even the OK sites are often worth your while, as castles are often built atop ridges and hills with spectacular vistas. Okinawa is a breath-takingly beautiful island, and even a site with scattered ruins can often be a wonderful experience for young and old.

            <H4>Overview - Chinen Castle</H4>
            <p>Chinen Castle is located on the south-east side of Okinwas South-East of Naha in Nanjo City (南城市). The castle is about 75m x 50m in area and at an altitude of 80m.  This site is peaceful and usually tourist free and has the feel of a nature walk.</p>
            <p>When visiting Chinen Castle Ruins, you’ll notice the original walls are darker, the rocks are smaller and less regular.  In contrast, the newer and/or reconstructed walls are made from limestone masonry, and are smoother and fit together well.  The walls are about 3m high, and the gates still have stone arches, now shored up with timbers.  The eastern side is the old castle, and the western side is the new castle.  The newer section was built by King Sho Shin (尚真) who reigned 1477-1526, and later would unify the three kingdoms by confiscating all weapons and moving all Aji and their families to the Shuri Castle area.</p>
            <p>The area around Chinen Castle Ruins also hold the Tomb of Lord Chinen (知念按司の墓), Chinen Spring (aka Chinen Aqueduct 知念大川), and the Ufakaru (ウファカル) which is believed to be the original location of rice cultivation in Okinawa.</p>
            <p>Chinen castle was one of the holy sites on the Agariumai pilgrimage, which was historically taken by Okinawan royalty from Shuri Castle east to Chinen in the 1300’s. In 1970 it was designated a National Historic Site.</p>

            <H4>On The Trail - Chinen Castle</H4>
            <p>Park at the Chinenjoato Parking Lot, it’s marked by a bilingual “Chinen Castle Site”, parking sign with the international blue and white “P”.  The elevation of the parking area is about 110m, which is slightly above Chinen Castle, which stands at about 80m.</p>
            <p>Across the road by the guard rail, you’ll see the “Chinen Castle Ruins” sign with a brown arrow pointing down and to the right, indicating the trailhead.  At the trailhead two informational boards stand; the left hand all-Japanese info board is summarized here:</p>
            “Chinen Gusuku Historical Site
            The site consists of two castles; Mii-gusuku (newer), and Kou-gusuku (older).  The site underwent some construction during a period 1761-1903, and is a historical site for religious/cultural pilgrimage.”
            <p>The right hand info board, has English translations and explains the history and significance of the area;</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <strong>Chinen Gusuku Guide Map</strong><BR>
              This is a settlement at the foot of Chinen Gusuku, and it was an area governed by the high priestess Kikoe Ogimi during the Ryukyu Kingdom period.  Together with Tamagusuku it is said that the area was also the point of origin in rice cultivation.  This is an area where there are many shrines and wells, and it can be said that this is a place where the spirit of ancient times, when people had their daily life closely connected with the cultural assets, still prevails in this area.<BR>
              The Otsunahiki Tug of War in Chinen takes place every five years.  It was discontinued in 1958, but it was revived in 2003.

            <p>The asphalt path runs gently downhill about 150m from the trailhead to the castle, and is bordered by jungle growth that almost meets overhead and affords some welcome shade with the sounds of the local birds.</p>
            <p>Within sight of the castle, on the right hand side is a white marker with Japanese for “Noro Mansion Ruins” (ノロ屋敷跡), this was the home of the priestess or “Noro”.  The trail is a small loop that enters and comes out ahead on the path about 6m (20’) down the road between a low stone wall that has tree roots growing from it.  As you approach Chinen Castle, there is a stone monument on the left with the name in Japanese (知念城跡).  A stone ramp with a few low steps rises up to the main gate, which is shored up with wood beams holding up the stone arch.  There are actually two gates on this north side, the main gate here and a second further down the road.  Enter the main gate, and you’ll get a sense of how thick the walls are.  You have entered the “new” castle area.  If you were to follow the wall to the left (east), you’d enter the tree covered area that was the old castle.  After you pass through the main gate, the 2nd gate is up along the wall to your right and next to the hinukan, which is the location of the house fire spirit.  Check out the 2nd arched stone gate, then take the path that leads to the top of this main wall.  When you’re ready make your way back down, and walk across the flat grassy area inside the castle to the far wall, which is lower and take in the views out to the ocean.  Make your way back to the road and as you continue down it, you’ll see a trio of brown signs for:

              <LI>Ufakaru (rice origins)</LI>
              <LI>The Tomb of Lord Chinen</LI>
              <LI>Chinen Ukka (spring)</LI>
            </UL>
            </p>
            <p>Continue past the signs and you’ll see a path off to your right with some low stone steps, up to the Ufakaru, the traditional location of the first rice cultivation in Okinawa. Make your way back down and continue along the road, the pavement will end, and become a green tunnel of jungle that heads downhill, and eventually opens up to the Chinen Ukka (spring) area, that has  ancient stone floor sand walls, and just past this you’ll see a white information marker, for the spring;</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <strong>Chinen Ukka</strong><BR>
              The Chinen Ukkaa's source is a spring called the "Ufakaru", and lies under the cliff behind it.  In the "Chuzan Seikan" (History of Ryukyu)(1650), it is written that "Amamikiyo (the creator of the Ryukus) planted rice in the rice paddies behind the Chinen Ukkaa and the Ukinji Hainju site (Two natural springs, once called "received water", the other called "running water") in Tamagusuku".  From this, the Chinen Ukkaa became a holy site where the Ryukyu King came personally to worship, and is now part of the present Agari Umaai.
            </blockquote>
            <p>And underneath this description, a 2nd description is of the Agari Umaai pilgrimage;</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <strong>The origins of the Agari Umaai</strong><br>
              The "Agari Umaai" is a pilgrimage to sacred sites in Chinen and Tamagusuku, wehre it is said that the Amamikiyo Zoku (people of the goddess Amamikiyo), the ancestors of the people of Okinawa, settled.  Since the areas of Ozato, Sashiki, Chinen and Tamagusuku, with Shurijo Castle as their center were collectively called the "Agarikata", this pilgrimage to the sacred sites in Chinen and Tamagusuku was thus called the "Agari Umaai". The Ryukyuan king personally made pilgrimages to Kudaka Island, which was believed to be where wheat and rice cultivation originated.

            <p>From here you can take the trail that heads uphill to the Tomb of Chinen, which is a small stone shrine.  From here you can work your way back downhill which may be harder than going up, make your way back to the spring, then to the castle, and finally to the parking lot.  Now it’s time for refreshments and maybe a side trip.
